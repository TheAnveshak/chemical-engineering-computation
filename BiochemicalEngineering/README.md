## Overview

This directory contains an academic design study for the production of **1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) from glycerol using engineered microbial systems**.

The work consolidates fragmented approaches reported across literature-ranging from metabolic pathway design to fermentation scale-up and downstream separation-into a single, coherent process workflow. The objective is not to propose a definitive industrial flowsheet, but to demonstrate how biochemical, transport, and process design considerations can be integrated consistently.

## Scope of work

The study covers:

- Metabolic pathway analysis and host selection
- Fermentation strategy and scale-up assumptions
- Reactor modeling and kinetic parameter fitting
- Downstream processing and separation alternatives
- Order-of-magnitude market and feasibility assessment

All modeling and calculations are presented explicitly in the report and associated notebooks.

## Nature of the work

This project was developed as part of **academic coursework** and reflects an educational design exercise. The analysis combines established theory with literature-derived data and simplifying assumptions appropriate for classroom-scale process synthesis.

The content is intended for learning, discussion, and methodological illustration rather than for direct industrial application.

## Report and structure

- The complete technical report is written in LaTeX and organized as a conventional chemical/biochemical engineering design document.
- References are cited throughout and listed at the end of the report.

Readers are encouraged to consult the report PDF for detailed derivations, assumptions, and discussion.

### Model fitting notebooks

Alongside the report, this repository includes Jupyter notebooks focused on **kinetic model fitting** for biochemical systems. These notebooks cover:

* Single-substrate kinetic model fitting
* Bi-substrate kinetic models, including:

  * Ternary-complex mechanisms
  * Ping–pong Bi–Bi mechanisms

The notebooks are intended to demonstrate how standard biochemical kinetics models can be translated into computational form and fitted to data under academic assumptions. They are exploratory and instructional in nature rather than exhaustive or definitive.

### Notes and background material

Supplementary academic notes and personal understanding related to biochemical engineering, kinetics, and thermodynamics are maintained separately in the following repository:

* [https://github.com/TheAnveshak/Anvesiki/tree/main/Chemical_Engineering_101/BioChemical](https://github.com/TheAnveshak/Anvesiki/tree/main/Chemical_Engineering_101/BioChemical)

These notes reflect personal learning and interpretation of standard literature and coursework. They are provided for context and reference only and should be read as study material rather than authoritative sources.

## LaTeX template

The report uses a custom LaTeX template designed for long, equation-heavy engineering documents.
A cleaned and reusable version of this template is provided separately in the `latex-report-template/` directory for general use.
