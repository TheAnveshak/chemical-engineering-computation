  abstract = {Mathematical modeling is a powerful and inexpensive approach to provide a quantitative basis for improvements that minimize the negative effects of bioreactor heterogeneity. For a model to accurately represent a heterogeneous system, a flow model that describes how mass is channeled between different zones of the bioreactor volume is necessary. In this study, a previously developed compartment model approach based on data from flow-following sensor devices was further developed to account for dynamic changes in volume and flow rates and thus enabling simulation of the widely used fed-batch process. The application of the dynamic compartment model was demonstrated in a study of an industrial fermentation process in a 600 m3 bubble column bioreactor. The flow model was used to evaluate the mixing performance by means of tracer simulations and was coupled with reaction kinetics to simulate concentration gradients in the process. The simulations showed that despite the presence of long mixing times and significant substrate gradients early in the process, improving the heterogeneity did not lead to overall improvements in the process. Improvements could, however, be achieved by modifying the dextrose feeding profile.},

  abstract = {The worldwide surplus of glycerol generated as inevitable byproduct of biodiesel fuel and oleochemical production is resulting in the shutdown of traditional glycerol-producing/refining plants and new applications are needed for this now abundant carbon source. In this article we report our finding that Escherichia coli can ferment glycerol in a pH-dependent manner. We hypothesize that glycerol fermentation is linked to the availability of CO2, which under acidic conditions is produced by the oxidation of formate by the enzyme formate hydrogen lyase (FHL). In agreement with this hypothesis, glycerol fermentation was severely impaired by blocking the activity of FHL. We demonstrated that, unlike CO2, hydrogen (the other product of FHL-mediated formate oxidation) had a negative impact on cell growth and glycerol fermentation. In addition, supplementation of the medium with CO2 partially restored the ability of an FHL-deficient strain to ferment glycerol. High pH resulted in low CO2 generation (low activity of FHL) and availability (most CO2 is converted to bicarbonate), and consequently very inefficient fermentation of glycerol. Most of the fermented glycerol was recovered in the reduced compounds ethanol and succinate (93\% of the product mixture), which reflects the highly reduced state of glycerol and confirms the fermentative nature of this process. Since glycerol is a cheap, abundant, and highly reduced carbon source, our findings should enable the development of an E. coli-based platform for the anaerobic production of reduced chemicals from glycerol at yields higher than those obtained from common sugars, such as glucose. ß 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

To ensure that quality of life is maintained in the future, it is imperative that we move towards a circular economy, where care is taken to reuse or recycle materials at their end-of-life and new chemicals and materials are sourced from renewable carbon feedstocks such as biomass. To achieve this transition, efficient conversion methods by which biomass-derived feedstocks can be converted to chemicals are required. The high degree of functionalisation (               i.e.               high content of oxygen atoms) of biomass-derived feedstocks, makes their conversion by microbial fermentation an interesting option. This article provides an overview of currently available fermentation technologies that have the potential to play a role in the production of biobased bulk chemicals in a circular economy in the period up to 2050. Our focus is primarily on technologies that are sufficiently mature to have been implemented on (at least) industrial pilot scale. In addition to an overview of available technologies, we provide a critical assessment of their potential relevance for use in the production of bulk chemicals in a future circular economy. We conclude that seven fermentation processes for the production of (potential) bulk chemicals have already reached a stage of technological maturity where they are ready to be applied in a circular economy. A number of other processes may reach this stage of maturity in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Anaerobic fermentation of glycerol in the Enterobacteriaceae family has long been considered a unique property of species that synthesize 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO). However, we have discovered that Escherichia coli can ferment glycerol in a 1,3-PDO-independent manner. We identified 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) as a fermentation product and established the pathway that mediates its synthesis as well as its role in the metabolism of glycerol. We also showed that the trunk pathway responsible for the conversion of glycerol into glycolytic intermediates is composed of two enzymes: a type II glycerol dehydrogenase (glyDH-II) and a dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK), the former of previously unknown physiological role. Based on our findings, we propose a new model for glycerol fermentation in enteric bacteria in which: (i) the production of 1,2-PDO provides a means to consume reducing equivalents generated in the synthesis of cell mass, thus facilitating redox balance, and (ii) the conversion of glycerol to ethanol, through a redox-balanced pathway, fulfills energy requirements by generating ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. The activity of the formate hydrogen-lyase and F0F1-ATPase systems were also found to facilitate the fermentative metabolism of glycerol, and along with the ethanol and 1,2-PDO pathways, were considered auxiliary or enabling. We demonstrated that glycerol fermentation in E. coli was not previously observed due to the use of medium formulations and culture conditions that impair the aforementioned pathways. These include high concentrations of potassium and phosphate, low concentrations of glycerol, alkaline pH, and closed cultivation systems that promote the accumulation of hydrogen gas.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Availability, low prices, and a high degree of reduction make glycerol an ideal feedstock to produce reduced chemicals and fuels via anaerobic fermentation. Although glycerol metabolism in               Escherichia coli               had been thought to be restricted to respiratory conditions, we report here the utilization of this carbon source in the absence of electron acceptors. Cells grew fermentatively on glycerol and exhibited exponential growth at a maximum specific growth rate of 0.040 ± 0.003 h               −1               . The fermentative nature of glycerol metabolism was demonstrated through studies in which cell growth and glycerol utilization were observed despite blocking several respiratory processes. The incorporation of glycerol in cellular biomass was also investigated via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of cultures in which either 50\% U-               13               C-labeled or 100\% unlabeled glycerol was used. These studies demonstrated that about 20\% of the carbon incorporated into the protein fraction of biomass originated from glycerol. The use of U-               13               C-labeled glycerol also allowed the unambiguous identification of ethanol and succinic, acetic, and formic acids as the products of glycerol fermentation. The synthesis of ethanol was identified as a metabolic determinant of glycerol fermentation; this pathway fulfills energy requirements by generating, in a redox-balanced manner, 1 mol of ATP per mol of glycerol converted to ethanol. A fermentation balance analysis revealed an excellent closure of both carbon (∼95\%) and redox (∼96\%) balances. On the other hand, cultivation conditions that prevent H               2               accumulation were shown to be an environmental determinant of glycerol fermentation. The negative effect of H               2               is related to its metabolic recycling, which in turn generates an unfavorable internal redox state. The implications of our findings for the production of reduced chemicals and fuels were illustrated by coproducing ethanol plus formic acid and ethanol plus hydrogen from glycerol at yields approaching their theoretical maximum.},

  abstract = {In the face of shortage of fossil fuel supplies and climate warming triggered by excessive carbon dioxide emission, alternative resources for chemical industry have gained considerable attention. Renewable resources and their derivatives are of particular interest. Glycerol, which constitutes one of the by-products during biodiesel production, is such a substrate. Thus, generated excess glycerol may become an environmental problem, since it cannot be disposed of in the environment. The most promising products obtained from glycerol are polyols, including 1,3-propanediol, an important substrate in the production of synthetic materials, e.g. polyurethanes, unsaturated polyesters, and epoxy resins. Glycerol can be used as a carbon and energy source for microbial growth in industrial microbiology to produce 1,3-propanediol. This paper is a review of metabolic pathways of native producers and E. coli with the acquired ability to produce the diol via genetic manipulations. Culture conditions during 1,3-PDO production and genetic modifications of E. coli used in order to increase efficiency of glycerol bioconversion are also described in this paper.},

The microbial conversion of 1,3-PD from glycerol by this recombinant               E. coli               strain was studied in a two-stage fermentation process. During the first stage, a novel high-cell-density fermentation step, there was significant cell growth and the majority of the metabolites produced were organic acids, mainly acetate. During the second stage, glycerol from the fresh medium was rapidly converted to 1,3-PD following a temperature shift from 30°C to 42°C. The by-products were mainly pyruvate and acetate. During this two-stage process, the overall 1,3-PD yield and productivity reached 104.4 g/liter and 2.61 g/liter/h, respectively, and the conversion rate of glycerol to 1,3-PD reached 90.2\% (g/g). To our knowledge, this is the highest reported yield and productivity efficiency of 1,3-PD with glycerol as the sole source of carbon. Furthermore, the overall fermentation time was only 40 h, shorter than that of any other reports.},

  abstract = {This paper considers a dynamic optimization problem (DOP) of 1,3-propanediol fermentation process (1,3-PFP). Our main contributions are as follows. Firstly, the DOP of 1,3-PFP is modeled as an optimal control problem of switched dynamical systems. Unlike the existing switched dynamical system optimal control problem, the state-dependent switching method is applied to design the switching rule. Then, in order to obtain the numerical solution, by introducing a discrete-valued function and using a relaxation technique, this problem is transformed into a narticlear parameter optimization problem (NPOP). Although the gradient-based algorithm is very efficient for solving NPOPs, the existing algorithm is always trapped in a local minimum for such problems with multiple local minima. Next, in order to overcome this challenge, a gradient-based random search algorithm (GRSA) is proposed based on an improved gradient-based algorithm (IGA) and a novel random search algorithm (NRSA), which cannot usually be trapped in a local minimum. The convergence results are also established, and show that the GRSA is globally convergent. Finally, a DOP of 1,3-PFP is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the GRSA proposed by this paper.},

  abstract = {1,3-Propanediol (PDO) is an appealing chemical for use in the production of new types of polymers such as polytrimethyleneterephthalate (PTT). In particular, the recent successful replacement of chemical routes for PDO production by a biological process makes PDO a prominent green chemical from renewable materials. This chapter first briefly describes the properties, uses, and production methods of PDO and PTT. Emphases are then laid on describing the biotechnological production of PDO in more detail, ranging from substrates, microorganisms, metabolic pathway engineering to fermentation processes and downstream processing. The different fermentation processes and downstream processing methods are compared, in terms of both technology and economy. It is evident that not only the glucose-based bioprocess, but also the bioconversion of glycerol into PDO is technologically and economically sound. Especially, a new biorefinery concept using a microbial community for glycerol bioconversion into PDO and bioenergy is illustrated which is attractive due to its simplicity and very low production costs. Perspectives and further research needs to this end are discussed.},
